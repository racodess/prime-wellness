## Prime Wellness App

As the project lead for the Prime Wellness app, a conceptual health and fitness application, I guided a team through the design and documentation of a comprehensive app solution. This project, developed for a school assignment, aimed to simulate the creation of a digital platform for a fictional fitness company, Solid Bodies. Our goal was to enhance user engagement through fitness tracking, appointment scheduling, and nutritional advice, leveraging agile development methodologies and user-centered design principles.

## User Stories Design

Crafted detailed narratives to capture the app's functionality from the end-user's perspective, ensuring a user-centric design approach. These stories covered various aspects of the app, including registration, profile management, appointment scheduling, and progress tracking. For each user story, defined specific conditions that must be met to achieve user satisfaction and ensure comprehensive coverage of user needs and expectations.

## Test Cases Development

Developed a structured test plan to validate the functionality, usability, and reliability of the app against the user stories and requirements. This included functional tests for user registration, notifications, appointment scheduling, and progress tracking. Also outlined a verification strategy to ensure each feature's implementation aligns with the user stories' acceptance criteria, focusing on user experience and app performance.

## Agile Methodology

Adopted the SCRUM methodology to manage the project, emphasizing iterative development, team collaboration, and flexibility in responding to changes. This approach facilitated a dynamic design and development process, allowing for continuous improvement based on stakeholder feedback.

## Design and Architecture

Utilized flow charts, sequence diagrams, and screen mockups to visualize the app's design, focusing on creating an intuitive and accessible user interface. Also detailed the app's architectural design, including data management, security measures, and cross-platform compatibility, ensuring a robust and scalable solution.
